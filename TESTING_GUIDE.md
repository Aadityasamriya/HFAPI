## ‚ú® Best Practices for Testing

1. **Test as different user types**: New user, existing user, admin
2. **Test edge cases**: Very long text, special characters, rapid actions
3. **Test error scenarios**: Invalid input, network issues, timeouts
4. **Test performance**: How fast does bot respond? Are there delays?
5. **Test security**: Try to break rate limits, inject code, upload malicious files
6. **Test user experience**: Is everything clear? Are errors helpful?
