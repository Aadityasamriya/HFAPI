```
You: Hello! How are you today?
Bot: Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm here and ready to help you with any questions, tasks, or conversations you'd like to have. How can I assist you today?

You: What's the weather like?
Bot: I don't have access to real-time weather data, but I'd be happy to help you find weather information! You could check a weather app or website like weather.com or your local weather service. Is there anything else I can help you with?

You: Tell me a joke
Bot: Here's a programming joke for you: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! üòÑ Would you like to hear another one or can I help you with something else?
```

### Question Answering
Ask any question - the bot's intelligent routing will select the best AI model:

**Examples:**
```
You: What is quantum computing?

You: How do I make pasta?
Bot: Here's a simple pasta recipe: 1) Boil salted water in a large pot, 2) Add pasta when water is boiling rapidly, 3) Cook according to package directions (usually 8-12 minutes)...

You: Explain machine learning in simple terms
Bot: Machine learning is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make decisions, similar to how humans learn from experience...
```

---

## üíª PROGRAMMING & CODE ASSISTANCE

### Code Generation
Request code in any programming language:

**Examples:**
```
You: Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
Bot: Here's a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms"""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

You: Create a JavaScript function to validate email addresses
Bot: Here's a JavaScript function to validate email addresses:

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    // Regular expression for email validation
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    
    // Check if email matches the pattern
    return emailRegex.test(email);
}

// Enhanced validation with additional checks
function validateEmailAdvanced(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
    
    if (!email || typeof email !== 'string') {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Basic format check
    if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Additional length and structure checks
    if (email.length > 254) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example usage
console.log(validateEmail("user@example.com")); // true
console.log(validateEmail("invalid.email"));     // false
```
```

### Code Explanation and Debugging
Send code snippets for explanation or debugging help:

**Example:**
```
You: Explain this code:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

Bot: This is a binary search algorithm implementation! Here's how it works:

**Purpose:** Efficiently finds a target value in a sorted array
**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - much faster than linear search

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. `left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1` - Initialize search boundaries
2. `while left <= right:` - Continue while search space exists
3. `mid = (left + right) // 2` - Find middle index
4. `if arr[mid] == target:` - Found target, return index
5. `elif arr[mid] < target:` - Target is in right half, adjust left boundary
6. `else:` - Target is in left half, adjust right boundary
7. `return -1` - Target not found

**Key Requirements:**
- Array must be sorted
- Returns index if found, -1 if not found

**Example usage:**
```python
sorted_array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
result = binary_search(sorted_array, 7)  # Returns 3
```
```
