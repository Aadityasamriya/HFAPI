Final and Complete Prompt for Replit Developer

Title: Final Fixes: Make the Bot Fully Functional and Secure

Hello,

The Telegram bot project is very well-built, but it's currently not working correctly due to a few key issues. Your task is to fix all the remaining problems so we can launch a bot that is fully functional, reliable, and secure.

Please address the following tasks in order of priority.

Task 1: Get the Bot's AI "Brain" Working Again (Highest Priority)

Problem: The bot's main AI features are completely turned off because of two critical bugs.

1.1. The Faulty Health Checker: The bot has a system to check if the AI models are "healthy" before using them. This system is broken and is telling the bot that all AI models are offline, even when they are working. Because of this, the bot refuses to send any questions to the AI.

Action: First, temporarily disable this health checker so the bot starts using the AI again. After that, build a new, simpler health check that just confirms the main AI service is online.

1.2. The Broken Reporting Form: When the bot tries to understand a user's request, it fills out an internal "report" on what it found. The template for this report was updated, but the part of the bot that fills it out is still using the old version. This mismatch causes the system to crash every time it tries to understand a user.

Action: Update the bot's "intent classifier" to use the new, correct report template.

Task 2: Reconnect the Bot to the AI Services

Problem: The bot's contact list for its AI models is outdated, and it has the wrong address for one of its databases.

2.1. Outdated AI Contacts: The list of AI models the bot tries to use are no longer available. It's like trying to call phone numbers that are now disconnected.

Action: Run the special script in the project (discover_working_models.py) to find a new list of working AI models. Then, update the bot's main settings file (config.py) with this new list.

2.2. Wrong Database Address: The bot uses two databases. The main one is working fine, but it can't find the second one (Supabase) because the address is wrong. The bot is smart enough to work around this, but it needs to be fixed for best performance.

Action: Find and correct the address for the Supabase database in the bot's settings.

Task 3: Pass the Final Security Check

Problem: The bot failed its "Enterprise Security" audit. An automatic scan found six high-risk issues that must be fixed.

Action: Please fix the following six security problems:

A Database Loophole: A specific trick could allow a malicious user to harm the database.

Oversized Files: The bot is not correctly blocking files that are too large, which could be used to crash the system.

Leaked Secrets: Secret keys and passwords are not being properly hidden in the system's private logs.

Insecure Admin Setup: The special, one-time setup for the main administrator is not being enforced correctly.

A Weak Link in Storage: One part of the storage system is missing a required security function.

Revealing Error Messages: Some error messages show too much technical detail, which could help an attacker.

Task 4: Fix the Internal Testing System

Problem: The tools we use to automatically test the bot are broken. This means we can't be sure if new changes are safe. The bot itself is not the problem here, but the testing environment is.

Action: Update the testing scripts to use the correct, modern tools (AsyncMock instead of MagicMock). This will fix the tests and allow us to verify that the bot is working perfectly after all your changes.

Task 5: Final Polish and Cleanup

Problem: A few small issues need to be addressed to finalize the project.

Action:

Over-Sensitive Image Scanner: The security scanner for images is a little too strict and is sometimes blocking safe, normal images. Please adjust it to be more accurate.

Check Old Developer Notes: The original developers left "TODO" notes in the code. Please do a final search for all of these notes and make sure the issues they mention have been fixed.

What Success Looks Like

The project is finished when:

The bot's AI is working, and it can answer questions and generate code.

All six security issues are fixed, and the bot would pass a new security audit.

All the internal testing scripts run without any errors.

The bot starts and runs smoothly.
