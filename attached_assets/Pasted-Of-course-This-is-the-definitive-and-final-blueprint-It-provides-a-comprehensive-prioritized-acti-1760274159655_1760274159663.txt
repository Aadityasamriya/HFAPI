### **P0: CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTORE (Highest Priority)**

**Objective:** The bot's AI "brain" is currently offline. These tasks will restore all core AI functionality. Nothing else matters until these are complete.

#### **Task 1: Fix the Fatal Hugging Face API Integration**

*   **Problem:** The core module for calling the Hugging Face API (`HFInferenceProvider`) is fundamentally broken. It initializes the official `InferenceClient` but then ignores it, using raw, less reliable `aiohttp` calls. This is like having a high-end engine but trying to power the car by pushing it.
*   **Impact:** Bypasses all built-in resilience, retry logic, and connection management, causing instability and API failures.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/core/hf_inference_provider.py`
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Remove Raw API Calls:** In the `_safe_text_generation` method, delete the entire `aiohttp.ClientSession` block.
    2.  **Implement Correct Client Usage:** Replace the deleted block with a proper call to the initialized client: `self.client.text_generation(...)`.
    3.  **Ensure Asynchronicity:** The `InferenceClient`'s methods are synchronous. You **must** wrap the call in `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` to prevent it from freezing the entire bot.
    4.  **Fix Health Check:** In the `health_check` method, apply the same `asyncio.to_thread` wrapper to the `self.client.text_generation(...)` call to make the health check non-blocking.

#### **Task 2: Fix the `ClassificationResult` Constructor Crash**

*   **Problem:** The `AdvancedIntentClassifier` is the bot's "brain" for understanding user requests. It crashes every time because it's using an outdated form (`ClassificationResult`) that is missing 5 required fields.
*   **Impact:** **0% intent classification success.** The bot cannot understand any user input, which is a primary cause of its non-functional state.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/core/intent_classifier.py` (within the `classify_advanced` method)
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Find the line where `result = ClassificationResult(...)` is created.
    2.  Reference the `ClassificationResult` dataclass definition in `bot/core/bot_types.py`.
    3.  Add all 5 missing arguments with sensible default values to the constructor call. This will immediately stop the crashes.
        *   `domain_expertise=None`
        *   `context_awareness_score=0.5`
        *   `follow_up_likelihood=0.0`
        *   `multi_turn_context=None`
        *   `user_expertise_match=0.5`

#### **Task 3: Resolve All Critical AI Routing Bugs**

*   **Problem:** The `DynamicModelSelector`, which orchestrates the AI model selection, has multiple fatal errors related to incorrect object creation and method calls.
*   **Impact:** The bot's advanced routing and fallback logic will crash at runtime.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/core/dynamic_model_selector.py`
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Fix Missing Method:** Search and replace all calls to the non-existent `intelligent_router.get_recommended_model()` with the correct method: `intelligent_router.select_optimal_model()`.
    2.  **Fix `PromptComplexity` Object:** In all fallback scenarios, update the creation of `PromptComplexity` objects to use the correct parameter names and data types as defined in its dataclass in `bot/core/bot_types.py` (e.g., `reasoning_required` is a boolean, `domain_expertise` is a string).
    3.  **Fix `DomainExpertise` Usage:** The code incorrectly uses an object `DomainExpertise.GENERAL`. Replace this with the simple string `'general'`.
    4.  **Fix `None` Explanation:** The `ModelSelectionResponse` is being created with `explanation=None`. Modify the dataclass to allow this field to be `Optional` or create a default, empty `ModelSelectionExplanation` object to prevent type errors.

### **P1: FORTIFY THE FORTRESS (Enterprise Security Compliance)**

**Objective:** Patch all HIGH-risk security vulnerabilities to make the bot safe for production use and achieve a 100% security score. This is non-negotiable.

#### **Task 4: Patch All Security Vulnerabilities**

*   **Problem:** The bot fails its security audit with multiple high-risk vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, file size bypass, and sensitive data leakage.
*   **Impact:** The bot is insecure and vulnerable to attack.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/security_utils.py`, `bot/file_processors.py`, `bot/admin/middleware.py`.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Fix SQL Injection (`security_utils.py`):** In the `SQL_INJECTION_PATTERNS` list, add the pattern `r"\w'--"` to specifically catch the `admin'--` attack.
    2.  **Fix File Size Bypass (`file_processors.py`):** In the `validate_file_security` method, move the universal file size check (`if file_size > AdvancedFileProcessor.MAX_FILE_SIZE:`) to be the **very first line of code in the function**. This ensures no processing occurs on oversized files.
    3.  **Fix Sensitive Data Leaks (`security_utils.py`):** In the `DataRedactionEngine`, significantly enhance the regex patterns. Add exact length checks for all API key types (OpenAI, GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.) and add patterns for new services (Cohere, Groq, etc.). Make the database URL patterns more robust.
    4.  **Secure Admin Bootstrap (`admin/middleware.py`):** In the `@admin_required` decorator, add a strict check inside the `if allow_bootstrap:` block to ensure `user_id == Config.OWNER_ID`. If it doesn't match, log a security alert and deny access.

### **P2: ACHIEVE A SUPERIOR USER EXPERIENCE**

**Objective:** Make the bot feel more intelligent, responsive, and helpful than its competitors.

#### **Task 5: Implement Professional UX Enhancements**

*   **Problem:** The bot feels slow and unresponsive during long AI tasks, provides cryptic error messages, and has a confusing onboarding flow.
*   **Impact:** A frustrating user experience that drives users away.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/handlers/message_handlers.py`, `bot/handlers/command_handlers.py`
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Add Progress Indicators (`message_handlers.py`):** Before making a long-running AI call (like text or code generation), start an `asyncio.Task`. This task should send a "‚è≥ Still working..." or "ü§ñ Thinking..." message to the user every 10 seconds. Once the AI response is ready, cancel the task. This makes the bot feel alive and responsive, a better experience than a static cursor.
    2.  **Create User-Friendly Error Messages (`message_handlers.py`):** Implement a centralized error handling function that catches technical exceptions (`TimeoutError`, `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`) and translates them into polite, helpful messages with clear suggestions for the user.
    3.  **Redesign the Onboarding Flow (`command_handlers.py`):** Modify the `/start` command. For a new user (one without a saved API key), do not show the main menu. Instead, guide them through a clear, three-step process:
        *   **Step 1:** A welcoming message explaining the need for a free Hugging Face API key.
        *   **Step 2:** Wait for the user to paste their key.
        *   **Step 3:** Verify the key and, upon success, show a "Setup Complete!" message that unlocks all features. This is a much smoother experience than the current flow.

### **P3: FINAL POLISH AND FUTURE-PROOFING**

**Objective:** Update the configuration to use the best available free models and fix the internal test suite to ensure long-term stability.

#### **Task 6: Update the AI Model Configuration to Use High-Quality Free Models**

*   **Problem:** The `config.py` file lists many models that are inaccessible due to the exhausted API quota. We need to replace them with the best-performing models that are confirmed to work on the free tier.
*   **Impact:** This will restore full AI functionality and ensure the bot is using top-tier free models, directly contributing to its superiority.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** `bot/config.py`
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Replace the outdated and inaccessible model constants with the following high-quality, free-tier models. This selection is based on 2025 performance benchmarks for models known to have generous free access.
    2.  **Update `config.py` with this new model list:**

        ```python
        # In class Config within bot/config.py

        # === 2025 VERIFIED FREE & HIGH-PERFORMANCE MODELS ===
        # These models are selected for their top-tier performance and availability on the free tier.
        
        # Best for balanced, high-quality chat and complex reasoning
        DEFAULT_TEXT_MODEL = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
        
        # Best for code generation and technical tasks
        DEFAULT_CODE_MODEL = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct" # Phi-3 is also excellent for code
        
        # Best for fast, efficient responses
        EFFICIENT_TEXT_MODEL = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
        
        # Best for summarization and text-to-text tasks
        DEFAULT_SUMMARIZATION_MODEL = "facebook/bart-large-cnn"
        
        # Reliable fallback models
        FALLBACK_TEXT_MODEL = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
        FALLBACK_CODE_MODEL = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
        
        # ... update all other model constants to use these verified models as primaries and fallbacks ...
        FLAGSHIP_TEXT_MODEL = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
        ADVANCED_CODE_MODEL = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
        # etc.
        ```
    3.  **Add a prominent comment block** explaining that this list is optimized for the free tier and that a paid plan would unlock even more powerful models.

#### **Task 7: Fix the Broken Internal Test Suite**

*   **Problem:** The automated tests for the admin system are failing with `TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression`. This is because the tests are using the wrong mocking library for `async` functions.
*   **Impact:** We cannot reliably test our code or verify that your fixes are working correctly.
*   **File(s) to Edit:** All `*_test.py` files.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  Perform a global search and replace across all test files.
    2.  Replace every instance of `unittest.mock.MagicMock` that is used to mock an `async` function or method with `unittest.mock.AsyncMock`. This will make the test suite compatible with the bot's asynchronous code.

### **Definition of Done (Success Criteria)**

This project is complete when the bot meets all the following criteria:
1.  **Fully Functional:** The bot starts without errors and all AI features (text, code, etc.) are working perfectly using the new free-tier models.
2.  **Enterprise Secure:** All high-risk security vulnerabilities are patched. A new run of the security audit script would show 0 CRITICAL and ‚â§ 1 HIGH risk issues.
3.  **Superior UX:** The onboarding flow is streamlined, long-running tasks provide progress updates, and all error messages are user-friendly.
4.  **Stable and Testable:** All internal automated tests pass without any errors, confirming the stability of the codebase.
